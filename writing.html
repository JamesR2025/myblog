    <h2>Emptiness and Fullness</h2>
    <p>

        A farmer builds a dam <br>
        
        To be filled with water, <br>
        
        In preperation for the harvest. <br><br>
        
        
        A warrior sharpens his sword, <br>
        
        His body and mind, <br>
        
        In preparation for battle. <br><br>
        
        
        A tiger crouches, and stalks <br>
        
        It's prey <br>
        
        In preperation for the killing bite. <br><br>
        
        
        A difference in charges builds <br>
        
        Released in an instant.<br><br>
        
        Lightning tears through the sky. <br>
        
        Setting the oak ablaze <br><br>
        
        
        Energy accumulates in reserves <br>
        
        To be released at the proper time <br>

        In accordance with the Way <br>
